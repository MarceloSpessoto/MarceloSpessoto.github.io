I am Marcelo Spessoto and this is my personal web page, where I publish content regarding tech.

There is content about my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) experience, as well as other annotations regarding
free software and other topics related to software development.

I am trying to keep note on everything I study in the moment, and adapt it in form of blog posts to be
published here.
